      "**The Water Cycle: Nature’s Endless Journey**\n",
      "\n",
      "Every drop of water on Earth is part of a giant, never‑ending loop called the water cycle. This cycle moves water from the surface of the planet to the sky and back again, changing its form along the way. Understanding how the water cycle works helps us see why water is always available for plants, animals, and people—even though we never see a “big tank” of it sitting somewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Evaporation – Water Turns to Vapor  \n",
      "\n",
      "When the Sun shines on oceans, lakes, rivers, and even wet soil, it heats the water. The heat gives water molecules enough energy to break away from the surface and rise into the air as invisible water vapor. This process is called **evaporation**. Even the water in your own sweat or a puddle on a hot day will evaporate and join the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Transpiration – Plants Join the Party  \n",
      "\n",
      "Plants are also part of the cycle. Through tiny openings on their leaves called *stomata*, plants release water vapor into the air. This is called **transpiration**. When you add all the evaporation from bodies of water and the transpiration from plants together, scientists call the combined process **evapotranspiration**.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Condensation – Clouds Form  \n",
      "\n",
      "As water vapor rises, the air gets cooler. Cool air can’t hold as much vapor, so the water molecules slow down and stick together, forming tiny droplets or ice crystals. These tiny particles gather to make **clouds**. This change from gas back to liquid (or solid) is known as **condensation**.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Precipitation – Water Returns to Earth  \n",
      "\n",
      "When the droplets inside a cloud become heavy enough, gravity pulls them down. They fall as **precipitation**—rain, snow, sleet, or hail—depending on the temperature of the air they travel through. Precipitation is the way water returns to the land, oceans, and even underground.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Collection – Water’s Resting Places  \n",
      "\n",
      "After falling, water collects in several places:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Surface runoff** flows over the ground into streams, rivers, and eventually the ocean.  \n",
      "* **Infiltration** allows water to soak into the soil, recharging groundwater reservoirs called **aquifers**.  \n",
      "* Some water stays in **lakes, ponds, and wetlands**, where it can be used by plants, animals, and humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "From these collection points, the water can be evaporated again, and the cycle starts over.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why the Water Cycle Matters  \n",
      "\n",
      "* **Fresh water supply:** The cycle constantly refreshes the water we drink, irrigate crops with, and use for industry.  \n",
      "* **Climate regulation:** Water vapor is a greenhouse gas; its movement helps balance Earth’s temperature.  \n",
      "* **Ecosystem health:** Wetlands, rivers, and forests rely on a steady flow of water to support the plants and animals that live there.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Because the water cycle is driven mainly by the Sun’s energy, any change in the Sun’s intensity, Earth’s temperature, or human activities (like cutting down forests or building dams) can affect how quickly water moves through the system.\n",

      "Which of the following statements correctly describes the relationship between **evaporation** and **transpiration** in the water cycle?\n",
      "\n",
      "A. Evaporation occurs only over oceans, while transpiration occurs only in deserts.  \n",
      "B. Both processes turn liquid water into water vapor, and together they are called **evapotranspiration**.  \n",
      "C. Transpiration converts water vapor back into liquid droplets, whereas evaporation turns liquid water into ice crystals.  \n",
      "D. Evaporation releases water vapor from plant leaves, and transpiration releases it from soil surfaces.\n",

      "**Correct Answer:** **B**  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation:**  \n",
      "- **Evaporation** is the process by which heat from the Sun turns liquid water from oceans, lakes, rivers, soil, etc., into water vapor.  \n",
      "- **Transpiration** is the release of water vapor from the tiny openings (stomata) on plant leaves.  \n",

      "| **2** | **B** – Chlorophyll a | Chlorophyll a is the primary pigment that transfers excitation energy to the reaction centre of photosystem II and I. Chlorophyll b and carotenoids (carotene) act as accessory pigments, broadening the spectrum but not the main energy‑capturing pigment. Phycobilins are found in cyanobacteria and red algae, not in typical terrestrial plants. |\n",
      "| **3** | **C** – Thylakoid membrane | The light‑dependent (photochemical) reactions—photosystem II, the cytochrome b₆f complex, photosystem I, and ATP synthase—are all embedded in the thylakoid **membrane**. The thylakoid lumen (B) is the interior space where a proton gradient builds, but the electron‑transfer proteins reside in the membrane. The stroma (A) hosts the Calvin‑Benson cycle, not the light reactions. |\n",
      "| **4** | **D** – CO₂ | The light‑dependent reactions produce **ATP**, **NADPH**, and **O₂** (as a by‑product of water splitting). CO₂ is a substrate for the Calvin‑Benson cycle (the light‑independent reactions) and is **not** generated by the light reactions. |\n",
      "| **5** | **A** – 3‑phosphoglycerate (3‑PGA) | Rubisco adds CO₂ to ribulose‑1,5‑bisphosphate (RuBP) forming an unstable 6‑carbon intermediate that immediately splits into **two molecules of 3‑PGA**. The other listed compounds appear later in the cycle (G3P) or are not directly produced (RuBP is regenerated, not a product of fixation). |\n",
      "| **6** | **B** – CO₂ concentration | In a well‑watered plant under bright light, light and water are already saturating. The next limiting factor is the availability of CO₂ (the substrate for Rubisco). Temperature (A) can become limiting only if it deviates far from the optimum; Light intensity (C) is already high; Soil pH (D) influences nutrient availability but is a secondary effect. |\n",
