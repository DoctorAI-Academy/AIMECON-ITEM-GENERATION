    "1. **Perceive** its environment (receive inputs and context)\n",
    "2. **Reason** about what actions to take (plan and decide)\n",
    "3. **Act** by using tools or generating outputs\n",
    "4. **Learn** from feedback to improve performance\n",
    "5. **Knowledge Base** The repository of information the agent uses to make decisions \n",
    "6. **Communication** Allows the agent to interact with other agents, systems, or humans.\n",

      "**The Water Cycle: Nature’s Endless Journey**\n",
      "\n",
      "Every drop of water on Earth is part of a continuous, never‑ending journey called the **water cycle** (or **hydrologic cycle**). This cycle moves water from the land, to the sky, and back again, changing its form along the way. Understanding how the water cycle works helps us see why water is so important for plants, animals, and people.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Evaporation\n",
      "\n",
      "The cycle begins when the Sun’s heat warms bodies of water—oceans, lakes, rivers, and even puddles. As the water gets warmer, some of it turns into invisible water vapor and rises into the air. This process is called **evaporation**. Plants also add water vapor to the air through a process called **transpiration**, which together with evaporation is sometimes called **evapotranspiration**.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Condensation\n",
      "\n",
      "High in the atmosphere, the water vapor cools down. When it cools enough, the vapor changes back into tiny liquid droplets or tiny ice crystals. These droplets group together to form clouds. This change from vapor to liquid (or ice) is called **condensation**.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Precipitation\n",
      "\n",
      "When clouds become heavy with water droplets or ice crystals, gravity pulls the water back toward Earth. The water falls as **precipitation**—rain, snow, sleet, or hail—depending on the temperature of the air it passes through.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Collection\n",
      "\n",
      "After reaching the ground, water takes several paths:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Runoff** – Water flows over the land’s surface into streams, rivers, and eventually back to the oceans.\n",
      "* **Infiltration** – Some water soaks into the soil, recharging underground reservoirs called **aquifers**.\n",
      "* **Absorption** – Plants absorb water through their roots, using it for growth and releasing some back into the air through transpiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "These pathways gather the water again, ready for the next round of evaporation.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why the Water Cycle Matters\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Fresh Water Supply** – The cycle constantly refills lakes, rivers, and groundwater that we use for drinking, farming, and industry.\n",
      "* **Weather and Climate** – The movement of water in the atmosphere drives weather patterns, from gentle breezes to powerful storms.\n",
      "* **Ecosystem Health** – Plants, animals, and microbes all rely on a steady supply of water to survive and thrive.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### A Quick Check\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **What causes evaporation?**  \n",
      "   *Answer: The Sun’s heat warms water, turning it into vapor.*\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **How do clouds form?**  \n",
      "   *Answer: Water vapor cools and condenses into tiny droplets or ice crystals.*\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Name two ways water returns to the ground after precipitation.**  \n",
      "   *Answer: Runoff (flowing over the land) and infiltration (soaking into the soil).*\n",

      "**Question:**  \n",
      "Which of the following correctly describes the process that combines the release of water vapor from both the Sun‑heated surface of water bodies *and* from plant leaves?\n",

      "**A.** Condensation – water vapor cools and forms clouds.  \n",
      "**B.** Precipitation – water falls to Earth as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.  \n",

      "**D.** Infiltration – water seeps into the soil to recharge aquifers.  \n",

      "**Correct Answer:** **C. Evapotranspiration** – it is the term used when the water vapor produced by evaporation of surface water and the vapor released by plant transpiration are considered together.\n"

      "**Correct Answer:** **D** (98 J)  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Explanation**\n",

      "The loss in gravitational potential energy equals the gain in kinetic energy:\n",

      "Thus,\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[\n",

      "\\[\n",
      "K = \\Delta U = 49\\ \\text{J}\n",
      "\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "But note that the block’s kinetic energy is **twice** this value because the block’s speed at the bottom is found from \\(v = \\sqrt{2gh}\\). Using that:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[\n",
      "v = \\sqrt{2gh} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 9.8 \\times 2.5} = \\sqrt{49} = 7\\ \\text{m/s}\n",
      "\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[\n",
      "K = \\frac12 m v^2 = \\frac12 (2)(7^2) = 1 \\times 49 = 49\\ \\text{J}\n",
      "\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually the correct kinetic energy is **49 J**, which corresponds to answer **A**.\n",

Carotene and xanthophyll are accessory pigments that broaden the spectrum but do not drive the primary photochemistry. Chlorophyll b assists chlorophyll a by harvesting additional light, but the “primary” pigment is chlorophyll a. |\n",

Option A is the net equation for cellular respiration (the reverse). Option B adds an extra 6 H₂O on the product side (\n"
