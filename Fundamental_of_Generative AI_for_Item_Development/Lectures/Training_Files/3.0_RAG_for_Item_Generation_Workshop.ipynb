        "\n",
        "Welcome to this hands-on workshop on using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for item generation. This session will provide you with both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills to build an AI-powered item generation tool that is grounded in authoritative content.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **What You'll Learn:**\n",
        "- The theoretical foundation of RAG and its applications in educational assessment\n",
        "- How to build a complete RAG pipeline using open-source tools\n",
        "- Best practices for generating high-quality, curriculum-aligned assessment items\n",
        "- Quality assurance and evaluation frameworks for AI-generated content\n",
        "- Ethical considerations and limitations in automated item generation\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Why RAG for Item Development?**\n",
        "Traditional AI language models can \"hallucinate\" or generate content that sounds plausible but isn't grounded in verified educational standards. RAG solves this by:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Retrieving** relevant content from authoritative sources (curriculum standards, textbooks, learning objectives)  \n",
        "**Augmenting** the language model with this context  \n",
        "**Generating** assessment items that are both creative and factually accurate\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it as giving the AI a \"reference library\" before it writes your exam questions thereby ensuring every generated item is anchored to verified content."

        "\n",
        "A typical RAG pipeline consists of several stages.  Each stage plays a distinct role in making sure that the final generated item reflects accurate curriculum content and is easy for educators to trust:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data ingestion and document preparation** – gather curricular materials and convert them into a uniform format that the computer can process, e.g, PDFs.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Splitting the documents (“chunking”)** – long texts are divided into smaller segments or *chunks*.  This is like breaking a textbook chapter into paragraphs so that the system can “digest” them.  Chunking is essential because language models can only process a limited amount of text at once; breaking the text into manageable pieces ensures that important details are not lost.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Embedding the documents** – each chunk is transformed into a numerical vector that captures its meaning.  Embeddings are like fingerprints for text: they allow the computer to measure which passages are most similar to a given query.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Vector store indexing** – all of these vectors are stored in a database designed to support similarity search.  You can think of it as a special index that lets you quickly find passages related to a topic.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Query and retrieval** – when you have a question or item to generate, your query is also embedded and compared against the database to retrieve the most relevant chunks.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Generation with context** – the retrieved text is combined with a large language model (LLM) to produce the assessment item.  Conditioning the model on actual curriculum content helps reduce hallucinations and ensures fidelity to the source material.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Evaluation and refinement** – finally, review and refine the generated items.  Research shows that techniques like key‑point extraction and careful prompting can improve coverage, grammar, and readability of items.\n",

By dividing a document into chunks, we ensure that each piece captures a coherent passage (for example, a paragraph or half‑page) and can be processed independently.

            "Explanation: \n",
            "Let's say the number of apples is x. Since each apple has 5 grams of sugar, the total sugar from apples is 5x. The number of oranges is not given, but we know the total sugar is 55 grams. Since oranges have twice as much sugar as apples, the sugar from one orange is 2 * 5 = 10 grams. We can represent the total sugar as an equation:\n",
            "5x + 10y = 55\n",
            "Since the problem doesn't give us the number of oranges, we can't find y directly, but we know that x must be a whole number. Looking at the options, if x = 5, the total sugar from apples would be 5 * 5 = 25 grams, which is too little to reach 55 grams when combined with oranges. If x = 55 / 5, this would be the same as x = 11, but this is not among the options. But option B) x = 10 would result in a total sugar of 5 * 10 = 50 grams from the apples. To get the total sugar to 55 grams, we need 55 - 50 = 5 grams from the oranges. Since each orange has 10 grams of sugar, we would need 5 / 10 = 0.5 oranges, but since the number of oranges must be a whole number, this is not a valid solution. However, we can try option B) x = 10 to see if it works. If x = 10, the total sugar from apples is 5 * 10 = 50 grams. To get the total sugar to 55 grams, we need 55 - 50 = 5 grams from the oranges. Since each orange has 10 grams of sugar, we would need 5 / 10 = 0.5 oranges, but since the number of oranges must be a whole number, we can try a different number of oranges. If we let y = 1, the total sugar from oranges would be 10 * 1 = 10 grams. This is too little, so we need to try a larger number of oranges. If we let y = 2, the total sugar from oranges would be 10 * 2 = 20 grams. This is still too little, so we need to try an even larger number of oranges. If we let y = 3, the total sugar from oranges would be \n",

        "By following these stages, collecting and splitting your knowledge base, embedding it, indexing it in a vector store, retrieving relevant passages, generating with context, and evaluating the results, you can build a retrieval‑augmented item generator tailored to your domain.  RAG’s strength lies in anchoring generative models to external knowledge, thereby producing responses that are both relevant and factual.  The LangChain framework provides convenient abstractions for each stage, and open‑source models make it accessible to everyone without proprietary licenses.  Adapt the code provided to your own knowledge base and continue experimenting with different models and prompts to achieve the best results."
