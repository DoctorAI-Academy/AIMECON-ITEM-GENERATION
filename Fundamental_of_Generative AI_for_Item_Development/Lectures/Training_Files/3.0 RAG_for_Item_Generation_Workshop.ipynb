    "## Workshop Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this hands-on workshop on using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for item generation. This session will provide you with both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills to build an AI-powered item generation tool that is grounded in authoritative content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What You'll Learn:**\n",
    "- The theoretical foundation of RAG and its applications in educational assessment\n",
    "- How to build a complete RAG pipeline using open-source tools\n",
    "- Best practices for generating high-quality, curriculum-aligned assessment items\n",
    "- Quality assurance and evaluation frameworks for AI-generated content\n",
    "- Ethical considerations and limitations in automated item generation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why RAG for Item Development?**\n",
    "Traditional AI language models can \"hallucinate\" or generate content that sounds plausible but isn't grounded in verified educational standards. RAG solves this by:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieving** relevant content from authoritative sources (curriculum standards, textbooks, learning objectives)  \n",
    "**Augmenting** the language model with this context  \n",
    "**Generating** assessment items that are both creative and factually accurate\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as giving the AI a \"reference library\" before it writes your exam questions thereby ensuring every generated item is anchored to verified content."

    "## 1. Pipeline Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical RAG pipeline consists of several stages.  Each stage plays a distinct role in making sure that the final generated item reflects accurate curriculum content and is easy for educators to trust:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data ingestion and document preparation** – gather curricular materials and convert them into a uniform format that the computer can process, e.g, PDFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Splitting the documents (“chunking”)** – long texts are divided into smaller segments or *chunks*.  This is like breaking a textbook chapter into paragraphs so that the system can “digest” them.  Chunking is essential because language models can only process a limited amount of text at once; breaking the text into manageable pieces ensures that important details are not lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Embedding the documents** – each chunk is transformed into a numerical vector that captures its meaning.  Embeddings are like fingerprints for text: they allow the computer to measure which passages are most similar to a given query.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Vector store indexing** – all of these vectors are stored in a database designed to support similarity search.  You can think of it as a special index that lets you quickly find passages related to a topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Query and retrieval** – when you have a question or item to generate, your query is also embedded and compared against the database to retrieve the most relevant chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Generation with context** – the retrieved text is combined with a large language model (LLM) to produce the assessment item.  Conditioning the model on actual curriculum content helps reduce hallucinations and ensures fidelity to the source material.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Evaluation and refinement** – finally, review and refine the generated items.  Research shows that techniques like key‑point extraction and careful prompting can improve coverage, grammar, and readability of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we explore each stage in detail, with code examples using open‑source models."

    "\n",
    "The first step is to collect the domain‑specific materials, which can be textbook chapters, lecture notes, curriculum standards, or any other documents that contain the knowledge your assessment should be based on.  These materials form the **knowledge base** that the RAG pipeline will consult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once collected, we need to convert them into a format that LangChain can process.  This involves reading files from disk and, importantly, **splitting** long documents into smaller pieces.  Splitting (also called *chunking*) is necessary because both embedding models and generative models have a maximum context length.  By dividing a document into chunks, we ensure that each piece captures a coherent passage (for example, a paragraph or half‑page) and can be processed independently.  Later, when we search the knowledge base, we will be comparing these chunks for relevance.\n",

      "Correct Answer: A) x = 4\n",
      "Explanation: Let's use a variable to represent the number of bananas, y. We know that Tom has 3 more apples than bananas, so the number of apples (x) can be expressed as x = y + 3. We are also given that the total number of fruits (apples + bananas) is 7, so we can write the equation x + y = 7. Substituting x = y + 3 into the equation, we get (y + 3) + y = 7. Simplifying, we get 2y + 3 = 7. Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get 2y = 4. Dividing both sides by 2, we get y = 2. Now that we know y = 2, we can substitute this value back into the equation x = y + 3 to find x. x = 2 + 3, so x = 5. However, this is not the correct answer because it says \"Tom has 3 more apples than bananas.\" We know y = 2 and x = 5, which means Tom has 3 more bananas than apples. This is the opposite of the statement in the problem. Therefore, we know that y = 3 and x = 6 is not the correct answer. However, we know that x = 3 + 3 is not the answer because it says \"If he has a total of 7 fruits.\" We know x + y = 7 and y = 3, so x = 4.\n",

      "Explanation: \n",
      "Given that Tom already has 5 apples and 7 oranges, the total number of fruits he has is 5 + 7 = 12. To keep the total number of fruits at least 15 but no more than 25, we can write the equation 12 + x ≥ 15 and 12 + x ≤ 25.

    "\n",
    "Automatically generated questions should not be used blindly; users need to review and refine them.  Research in retrieval‑augmented item generation has shown that methods like key‑point extraction and careful prompting can improve vital coverage, grammar and readability.  Some practical evaluation strategies include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Content alignment** – verify that each generated item accurately assesses the intended concept and at the appropriate cognitive level (e.g., recall, application, analysis).\n",
    "- **Correctness and clarity** – check that the question is unambiguous and that the answer provided is correct.\n",
    "- **Difficulty and distractor quality** – adjust the difficulty of multiple‑choice questions and ensure distractors (incorrect options) are plausible but clearly wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "For automation, **RAGAS** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Assessment Suite) offers useful metrics:  \n",
    "- **Context relevance** – retrieved passages match the query.  \n",
    "- **Faithfulness** – generation stays true to the context.  \n",
    "- **Answer correctness** – answer is supported by evidence.  \n",

    "## 8. Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these stages, collecting and splitting your knowledge base, embedding it, indexing it in a vector store, retrieving relevant passages, generating with context, and evaluating the results, you can build a retrieval‑augmented item generator tailored to your domain.  RAG’s strength lies in anchoring generative models to external knowledge, thereby producing responses that are both relevant and factual.  The LangChain framework provides convenient abstractions for each stage, and open‑source models make it accessible to everyone without proprietary licenses.  Adapt the code provided to your own knowledge base and continue experimenting with different models and prompts to achieve the best results."
