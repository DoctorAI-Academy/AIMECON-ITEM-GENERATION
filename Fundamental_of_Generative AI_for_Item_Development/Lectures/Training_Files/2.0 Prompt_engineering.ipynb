    "### Basic Concept\n",
    "Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective instructions for language models to get the best possible results. It means carefully choosing words, providing context, and structuring requests in ways that help LLMs produce more accurate, helpful, and on-target responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In item development, prompt engineering ensures that generated items are educationally sound, technically accurate, appropriately challenging, and consistently aligned with learning objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prompting Strategies\n",
    "Effective prompt engineering for item generation employs various strategic approaches, each designed to optimize specific aspects of LLM output.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Zero-shot Prompting\n",
    "This is the simplest prompting strategy where we give the AI instructions\n",
    "without any examples. It's like asking someone to do a task by just \n",
    "explaining what you want, without showing them how others have done it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use Zero-Shot:**\n",
    "1. Quick prototyping and testing\n",
    "2. Simple, straightforward tasks\n",
    "3. When you don't have good examples ready\n",
    "4. For creative tasks where you want variety\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "1. Less consistent formatting\n",
    "2. May misunderstand complex requirements\n",
    "3. Output quality can vary\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Few-shot Prompting\n",
    "Few-shot prompting is like teaching by showing examples. Instead of just\n",
    "telling the AI what to do, we show it a few examples of inputs and their\n",
    "desired outputs, and it learns the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use Few-Shot:**\n",
    "1. When you need consistent formatting\n",
    "2. When you have good examples available\n",
    "3. For complex tasks with specific patterns\n",
    "4. When zero-shot isn't giving consistent results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "1. More consistent output format\n",
    "2. Better understanding of requirements\n",
    "3. Can encode domain expertise through examples\n",
    "4. Reduces ambiguity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "1. Requires good quality examples\n",
    "2. Uses more tokens (costs more)\n",
    "3. Can overfit to example patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Chain-of-Thought Prompting\n",
    "Chain-of-thought prompting guides the AI through explicit step-by-step reasoning processes, making the model's thinking visible and systematic. This approach is particularly valuable for complex assessment item development where multiple considerations must be balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use Chain-of-Thought:**\n",
    "1. For complex assessment scenarios requiring multi-step analysis\n",
    "2. When generating items that test higher-order thinking skills\n",
    "3. For quality assurance and validation of item construction\n",
    "4. When transparency in the generation process is important\n",
    "5. For developing items with sophisticated distractors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "1. Improved reasoning quality: Forces systematic consideration of all aspects\n",
    "2. Transparency: Makes the generation process auditable and reviewable\n",
    "3. Better distractor development: Explicit focus on misconception-based options\n",
    "4. Quality control: Each step can be evaluated independently\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "1. Longer prompts and responses cost more token usage\n",
    "2. May generate unnecessarily complex items\n",
    "3. More processing time required\n",
    "4. Requires careful prompt structure to maintain consistency\n",

      "**Step 1 - Key concept analysis:**\n",
      "The question should test a student's ability to solve multi-step linear equations with variables on both sides. Specifically, it will assess:\n",
      "*   Setting up an equation from a word problem involving two competing scenarios.\n",
      "*   Using inverse operations to gather variable terms on one side of the equation.\n",
      "*   Using inverse operations to gather constant terms on the other side of the equation.\n",
      "*   Performing arithmetic operations with rational numbers (decimals in this case).\n",
      "*   Solving for the unknown variable.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 2 - Grade level appropriateness:**\n",
      "This concept is explicitly covered in Grade 8 mathematics standards (e.g., CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.8.EE.C.7.B: \"Solve linear equations with rational number coefficients, including equations whose solutions require expanding expressions using the distributive property and collecting like terms\"). The chosen numbers (integers for base fees, simple decimals for per-unit rates) are appropriate for Grade 8, focusing on the algebraic manipulation rather than complex arithmetic. The context of comparing two options is also very common for this grade level.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 3 - Real-world context:**\n",
      "A common and relatable scenario that naturally leads to comparing two linear relationships (and thus an equation with variables on both sides) is comparing service providers or subscription plans. Let's use **car rental companies** where each has a different base fee and a different per-mile charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 4 - Problem scenario:**\n",
      "\"Two car rental companies, 'Road Runner' and 'Speedy Wheels', offer different pricing plans. Road Runner charges a flat fee of $50 plus $0.20 per mile. Speedy Wheels charges a flat fee of $30 plus $0.30 per mile.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 5 - Question stem:**\n",
      "\"For how many miles driven would the total cost from both companies be the same?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Step 6 - Answer choices:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Let 'm' represent the number of miles driven.\n",
      "The equation is: `50 + 0.20m = 30 + 0.30m`\n",

Specifically, it will assess:\\n*   Setting up an equation from a word problem involving two competing scenarios.\\n*   Using inverse operations to gather variable terms on one side of the equation.\\n*   Using inverse operations to gather constant terms on the other side of the equation.\\n*   Performing arithmetic operations with rational numbers (decimals in this case).\\n*   Solving for the unknown variable.\\n\\n**Step 2 - Grade level appropriateness:**\\nThis concept is explicitly covered in Grade 8 mathematics standards (e.g., CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.8.EE.C.7.B: \"Solve linear equations with rational number coefficients, including equations whose solutions require expanding expressions using the distributive property and collecting like terms\"). The chosen numbers (integers for base fees, simple decimals for per-unit rates) are appropriate for Grade 8, focusing on the algebraic manipulation rather than complex arithmetic. The context of comparing two options is also very common for this grade level.\\n\\n**Step 3 - Real-world context:**\\nA common and relatable scenario that naturally leads to comparing two linear relationships (and thus an equation with variables on both sides) is comparing service providers or subscription plans.
